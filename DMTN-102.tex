\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The LSST Data Management System's (DMS) Alert Production (AP) pipeline will process new data as it is obtained by the telescope. Difference Imaging Analysis (DIA) will be performed, and all sources with a signal-to-noise ratio\reqparam{transSNR}\lsrreq{0101}\dmreq{0269}\dmreq{0274} $>5$ (in positive or negative flux) will be considered "detected", instantiate a record in the source catalogs, and generate an alert. 
%(\citeds{LPM-17}; LSR-REQ-0101, \citeds{LSE-29}; DMS-REQ-0269, -0274, \citeds{LSE-61}).
Each alert is a packet containing LSST data about the source such as coordinates, photometry, and image cutouts. For a full description of detected sources and alert packet contents, see \citeds{LSE-163}. The LSST alert stream will be delivered to several community-developed brokers, and also accessible to users\footnote{In this case, "users" is restricted to individuals with LSST data rights and access priviledges.} via an alert filtering service through the LSST Data Access Center (DAC). Plans and policies for alert distribution are provided in \citeds{LDM-612}. 

The purpose of this document is to quantitatively inform broker developers, and the broader scientific community planning to use alerts, on the key numbers regarding alert generation, distribution, and access via the LSST alert filtering service. The goals of this document are threefold: (1) to provide all of the key numbers regarding alert generation in one place; (2) to include any and all basis information, assumptions, and derivations that contributed to the key number; and (3) to be clear about whether each key number represents an estimate, a requirement, or a boundary. Wherever possible, the reference to a specific LSST requirement and any relevant requirement parameters are provided in the left-hand column. In this document we use 8 bits per byte ($\rm B$), and $1024$ $\rm B$ per $\rm KB$, $1024$ $\rm KB$ per $\rm MB$, and so forth.

\section{Alert Stream} \label{sec:alerts}

The concept and existence of the LSST alert stream was first introduced by the highest-level document, the LSST Science Requirements Document \citedsp{LPM-17}, which specifies that information about the detections of transient, variable, and moving objects be released promptly as a data stream. 

% % % % % % % % % % % % %
\subsection{Alert Release Timescale}\label{ssec:OTT1}

{\bf It is a formal requirement that the DMS make available $98\%$\reqparam{OTT1}\reqparam{OTR1}\lsrreq{0101}\lsrreq{0025}\ossreq{0127}\dmreq{0004} of alerts for each visit within $60$ seconds of the end of image readout\footnote{The design, minimum, and stretch values for the alert release timescale are $1$, $2$, and $0.5$ minutes \citedsp{LPM-17}.}.}

%The formal requirements on the DMS's alert release timescale are defined by the SRD\footnote{In the SRD, the design, minimum, and stretch values for the alert release timescale are $1$, $2$, and $0.5$ minutes, respectively.} \citedsp{LPM-17}, LSR-REQ-0101,-0025 \citedsp{LSE-29}, OSS-REQ-0127 \citedsp{LSE-30}, and DMS-REQ-0004 \citedsp{LSE-61}.
The term "make available" refers to the point at which an LSST alert packet becomes publicly available for broker retrieval (i.e., it does not include the time it takes for a broker to receive or ingest the alert). The LSR also specifies that all delayed alerts be made available at the next opportunity (see the discussion regarding delayed/failed alert distribution in \S~\ref{ssec:OTR1}).

% SRD states that {\it "data on likely optical transients ... will be released with a latency of at most {\tt OTT1} minutes"}, where the design, minimum, and stretch values for {\tt OTT1} are $1$, $2$, and $0.5$ minutes, respectively \citedsp{LPM-17}. The SRD's requirement flows down to the LSR, which also defines the fraction of alerts per visit that must be made available within {\tt OTT1} as {\tt OTR1}$=98\%$ (LSR-REQ-0101,-0025 \citeds{LSE-29}). The LSR's requirements on {\tt OTT1} and {\tt OTR1} flow down to the OSS (OSS-REQ-0127, \citeds{LSE-30}) and the DMSR (DMS-REQ-0004, \citeds{LSE-61}). 

% It is the intent of these requirements that {\tt OTT1} covers only the time that the DMS has control over: from the end of camera readout to the time the alert packet "crosses the border" of NCSA and becomes publicly available for the brokers (i.e., {\tt OTT1} does not include the time it takes for a broker to receive or ingest the alert).

% It is sometimes colloquially said that {\tt OTT1} starts {\it at the time of shutter close}, but it actually starts {\it at the end of readout} (i.e., $2$ seconds later, or longer if slower reads are adopted).

\subsection{Number of Alerts per Visit (and per Night)}\label{ssec:transN}

{\bf It is a formal requirement that the DMS sustain the generation of an average\reqparam{transN}\lsrreq{0101}\reqparam{nAlertVisitAvg}\ossreq{0193} of at least $10,000$ alerts per visit\footnote{The design, minimum, and stretch values for the number of alerts per visit are $10^4$, $10^3$, and $10^5$ \citedsp{LPM-17}.}, and an instantaneous maximum of at least $40,000$ alerts per visit.}

% The formal requirements on the DMS's ability to generate a minimum number of alerts per visit are defined by the SRD \citedsp{LPM-17}, LSR-REQ-0101 \citedsp{LSE-29}, and OSS-REQ-0193 \citedsp{LSE-30}. 

An approximate upper limit on the number of standard visits ($30$ second exposures plus $\sim4$ seconds of overhead) per night is $1,000$, which corresponds to a night with $\lesssim9.5$ hours of observing time. Pending updates to the OSS and the DMSR, these documents will clarify that the DMS must support a long-term average number of alerts per night of $10^7$ (i.e., $10^4$ alerts per visit for $10^3$ standard visits per night) and instantaneous peaks of $4\times10^4$ alerts per visit. At the time of writing, the latter was only defined in the DM sizing model \citedsp{LSE-81}.

% The SRD states that the DMS {\it "should be capable of reporting such data for at least {\tt transN} candidate transients per field of view and visit,"} where the design, minimum, and stretch values for {\tt transN} are $10^4$, $10^3$, and $10^5$ respectively \citedsp{LPM-17}. The SRD's requirement flows down to the LSR, in which it is unclear whether {\tt transN} refers to an average or an instantaneous limit (LSR-REQ-0101, \citeds{LSE-29}). The OSS clarifies this with a formal requirement that the DMS {\it "shall be sized to accommodate an average value of at least {\tt nAlertVisitAvg} alerts generated per standard visit"}, where {\tt nAlertVisitAvg} is $10^4$ (OSS-REQ-0193 in \citeds{LSE-30}). Pending updates to the OSS and the DMSR will clarify that the DMS must support a long-term average number of alerts per night of {\tt nAlertNightAvg} $=10,000,000$ (i.e., $10,000$ alerts per visit for $1000$ visits per night), and instantaneous peaks of {\tt nAlertVisitMax}$=40,000$ alerts per visit.

The value of $10^4$ alerts per visit is a formal requirement on the DMS and not a scientific estimate of the intrinsic rate of transients and variables in the universe. However, estimates for the most common transients and variables can be derived from the Science Book \citep{2009arXiv0912.0201L} by making some significant assumptions, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Variable Stars: LSST is predicted to observe a total of $\sim135$ million variable stars. Making the simple assumption that $20$/$80$\% of the stars are in extra/galactic fields, and that of the $\sim18,000$ $\rm deg^2$ surveyed by LSST, $80$/$20$\% of the fields are extra/galactic, and that $10$\% of all variable stars are detectably variable at any given time, then a typical extra/galactic field would yield $\sim1,800$/$28,800$ alerts per visit. Averaged over all fields, and weighted by $80$/$20$\% of the fields being extra/galactic, this is $7,200$ alerts per visit.
\item Supernovae: LSST is predicted to observe a total of $\sim10$ million supernovae in $10$ years, or $\sim1$ million per year. Since SNe are typically only visible for a few months, there might be $\sim0.3$ million detectable at any given time. Over $15,000$ $\rm deg^{2}$ of extragalactic survey area, that's $\sim20\ {\rm SNe\ deg^{-2}}$ or $\sim200$ alerts for SNe per visit.
\item Active Galactic Nuclei: LSST is predicted to observe millions of AGN. If $\sim10\%$ of them are detectably variable at any given time, then the estimate is $\sim0.1$ million alerts over $15,000\ {\rm deg^2}$ would generate $\sim7\ {\rm alerts\ deg^{-2}}$ or $\sim70$ alerts per visit for AGN.
\item Moving Objects: The number of Solar System objects that LSST is predicted to observe is dominated by the $5.5$ million main-belt asteroids. Assuming that they are spread evenly over the $\sim18,000$ $\rm deg^2$ survey area (even though they're not, as they're found primarily along the ecliptic) leads to $\sim3,000$ alerts per visit due to moving objects.
\end{itemize} 
Therefore, astrophysical estimates for the occurrence rates of alerts caused by the most common types of transients and variables yield $\sim5,100$/$32,000$ alerts per visit in extra/galactic fields, with an average of $\sim10,500$ alerts per visit.

\subsection{Alert Packet Size}\label{ssec:packet_size}

{\bf The size of an individual alert packet is estimated to be $\lesssim82$ $\rm KB$.}

There are no formal requirements regarding the alert packet size. The statement above is an estimate based on the planned content of the alerts as described in Section 3.5 of \citeds{LSE-163}. Simulated alert packets based on the Apache Avro format are at most $\sim82$/$126$ $\rm KB$, without/with the schema\footnote{The schema describes the formatting of the alert's contents (columns, units, etc.).}, respectively. This volume represents an alert packet for a variable star with a full $12$ month history of detections. 
%\textcolor{red}{As additional examples, a new unassociated source with only a single detection would be $\sim?$ $\rm KB$, and a $\sim1$ month long transient followed by $\sim11$ months of forced photometry would be $\sim?$ $\rm KB$.} 
The application of gzip compression can further reduce the size of an alert to $\sim65$ $\rm KB$ (JIRA ticket DM-16280). Cutout stamps included in the alert will be at least $30\times30$ pixels and contain flux ($32$ bit/pix), variance ($32$ bit/pix), and mask ($16$ bit/pix) extensions for both the template and difference image, plus a header of metadata \citedsp{LSE-163}. The stamps alone will contribute $\gtrsim18$ $\rm KB$ to the total size of the uncompressed alert packet (i.e., $\sim20\%$).

{\bf "Lite" Packet Options --} Brokers which plan to do their own source association, compile source catalogs based on alerts, or not use the image stamps might prefer a stream of packets with appropriately reduced information. The LSST DM team currently expects that providing a subset of alert packet contents will be feasible, and brokers may indicate which information they require during the broker proposal process  \citedsp{LDM-612}. As previously mentioned, removing the image stamps would reduce packet size by $\gtrsim18$ $\rm KB$. Removing the historical records of past detections would also reduce the size of all alert packets. A few of these options might also be available to users of the LSST alert filtering service (\S~\ref{sec:LAFS}). 


% % % % % % % % % % % % %
\subsection{Alert Stream Data Rate}\label{ssec:data_rate}

{\bf The time-averaged data rate of the alert stream is estimated to be $\sim25$ $\rm MB/sec$, potentially with bursts of up to $640$ $\rm MB/sec$.}

There are no formal requirements regarding the alert stream data rate. The values quoted in the statement above are estimates based on the expected size of an alert packet, the number of alerts per visit, and the alert distribution mechanism. The size of a single LSST alert will be $\sim82$ $\rm KB$ (including image stamps but not schema nor compression). Using an average of $\sim10^4$ alerts released per $\sim30$ second exposure $+2$ second readout, this leads to a {\it time-averaged} alert stream data rate of  $\sim25$ $\rm MB\ s^{-1}$. As discussed in \S~\ref{ssec:transN}, the number of alerts per field will vary in extra/galactic fields from $\sim2,000$ to $\lesssim40,000$, which would produce {\it time-averaged} alert streams of $\sim5$ to $\lesssim100$ $\rm MB\ s^{-1}$. However, in order to release alerts within $60$ seconds of image readout (\S~\ref{ssec:OTT1}), the stream will not be continuous in time, but periodic, with potential bursts: if all $10^4$ alerts are issued within the last $5$ seconds of that window the data rate would be $160$ $\rm MB\ s^{-1}$. In galactic fields with $\sim40,000$ alerts per visit this could be as high as $640$ $\rm MB\ s^{-1}$.


% % % % % % % % % % % % %
\subsection{Number of Selected Brokers}\label{ssec:num_brokers}

{\bf The DM team estimates that resources will allow for the delivery of the alert stream to $4$ to $7$ community brokers.}

There are no formal requirements on the number of brokers. The statement above is an estimate based on the alert stream data rate and the bandwidth allocated to alert distribution. As described in Section 2.2.3 of \citeds{LDM-612}: {\it "An allocation of $10$ $\rm Gbps$ is baselined for alert stream transfer from the [LSST Data Facility], with an estimated packet size of $82$ $\rm KB$ and up to $10,000$ alerts per visit. For illustration, based on these numbers up to $7$ brokers could receive the full stream if $5$ seconds is budgeted for outbound data transfer."} 


% % % % % % % % % % % % %
\subsection{Alert Database Volume}\label{ssec:adb_volume}

{\bf The estimated maximum upper limit for the full, 10-year alerts database is $\lesssim3$ $\rm PB$.}

There are no formal requirements on the alerts database volume. The statement above is an estimate based on the alert packet contents and the number of alerts per night. As described in \S~\ref{ssec:transN}, the DMS system will support an average of $\sim10$ million alerts per night (which approximately matches the expected scientific yields). Assuming the upper estimate of $\sim82$ $\rm KB$ per alert (\S~\ref{ssec:packet_size}), that leads to a total of $\sim782$ $\rm GB$ per night. An extreme upper limit is $365$ nights per year for 10 years, which would amount to $\sim2.7$ $\rm PB$ {\it at the very most}. Therefore we quote an extreme upper limit on the alerts database as $\lesssim3$ $\rm PB$. Compression could drastically lower this, as could reformatting: every alert contains a $\sim12$ month historical record and links to the most recent DIAObject and DR Object catalogs. The set of alerts for the same transient/variable would contain a significant amount of redundant information, which is provided to enable rapid filtering but could be reformatted for long-term storage (i.e., removed from the individual alerts and compiled elsewhere in an alerts database). 


% % % % % % % % % % % % %
\subsection{Delayed/Failed Alert Distribution}\label{ssec:OTR1}

{\bf It is a formal requirement that $\leq1\%$ ($\leq0.1\%$)\reqparam{sciVisitAlertDelay}\reqparam{sciVisitAlertFailure}\ossreq{0112} of all science visits experience delayed (failed) alert generation and distribution.}

Given the requirement in \S~\ref{ssec:OTT1} that $98\%$ of all alerts be made available within $60$ seconds, a visit would be considered "delayed" and count towards that $1\%$ limit if, and only if, $>2\%$ of its alerts were made available with a latency of $>60$ seconds. The requirement that $<0.1\%$ of all science visits fail to generate and/or distribute alerts is integrated over all stages of data handling (i.e., includes failures at any stage of prompt processing).

Assuming $\sim10,000,000$ alerts per night (\S~\ref{ssec:transN}), brokers can rely on the DMS to not exceed an upper limit of $\lesssim 200,000$ alerts ($\leq 2\%$) being made available with a latency of $>60$ seconds, and an upper limit of $\lesssim 10,000$ alerts or $1$ visit's worth ($\leq0.1\%$ of $\sim1,000$ visits per night) that fail to be generated and/or made available.

%The OSS specifies that {\it "no more than {\tt sciVisitAlertFailure} \% of science visits ... shall fail to be subjected to alert generation and distribution, integrated over all stages of data handling"}, where {\tt sciVisitAlertFailure} $=0.1\%$, and that {\it "no more than {\tt sciVisitAlertDelay} \% of science visits ... shall have their alert generation and distribution completed later than [{\tt OTT1}]"}, where {\tt sciVisitAlertDelay} $=1\%$ (OSS-REQ-0112; \citeds{LSE-30}). 
%\textcolor{red}{There is currently a change request in progress to clarify a few things about these requirements: (1) that a visit for which even $1$ alert is generated but never made available counts towards {\tt sciVisitAlertFailure}; (2) that visits for which $<98\%$ ({\tt OTR1}) of alerts are made available within {\tt OTT1} counts towards {\tt sciVisitAlertDelay}; and (3) to include similar requirements in the DMSR.} 


% % % % % % % % % % % % %
\subsection{Alert Stream Completeness and Purity}\label{ssec:comp_pure}

{\bf It is a formal requirement that DM derive and supply threshold values\reqparam{transSampleSNR}\reqparam{transCompletenessMin}\reqparam{transPurityMin}\ossreq{0353} for a spuriousness\footnote{In this context, spuriousness is like a real/bogus score.} parameter which can be used to filter alerts into a subsample of transient and variable objects with a given completeness and purity.}

The formal requirement is that DM calculate a spuriousness parameter for all alerts, and derive and supply a spuriousness threshold value that filters the full stream into a subsample of alerts for transient and variable objects\footnote{See also OSS-REQ-0354 for the required parameters for a subsample of moving objects \citedsp{LSE-30}.} which is $90\%$ complete and $95\%$ pure for all sources with a signal-to-noise ratio $>6$. While the requirements on purity and completeness are specified as point thresholds, DM expects to provide information to enable users to choose spuriousness threshold values which will filter the stream to a desired level of completeness and purity, thereby reducing the fraction of false positives (sources detected that are not astrophysical in origin) to a level that is appropriate for their science goals. Brokers could request a pre-filtered stream that includes a restriction on spuriousness.

%%% MLG: These are all about transSNR, not spuriousness.
% The SRD makes no statements about alert stream purity or completeness, but does state that the {\it "minimum signal-to-noise ratio in difference image for reporting detection of a transient object"} has a design specification of {\tt transSNR} $=5$ \citedsp{LPM-17}. The LSR contains essentially the same definition for {\tt transSNR}: {\it "the signal-to-noise ratio in single-visit difference images above which all optical transients are to be reported"} (LSR-REQ-0101; \citeds{LSE-29}). There is no minimum specification or stretch goal associated with {\tt transSNR}. However, as described in the DPDD, detections with {\tt transSNR} $>5$ but {\it "with high probability of being instrumental non-astrophysical artifacts may be excluded"} (Section 3.1, \citeds{LSE-163}), and a limited number of {\tt transSNR} $<5$ sources might be allowed to generate alerts (e.g., sources near a gravitational keyhole which could make an asteroid potentially hazardous; Section 3.2.1, \citeds{LSE-163}). 

% Regarding the alert stream completeness and purity, the OSS requires that {\it "there shall exist a spuriousness threshold {\tt T}, for which the completeness and purity of selected difference sources are higher than {\tt transCompletenessMin} and {\tt transPurityMin}, respectively, at the SNR detection threshold {\tt transSampleSNR}. This requirement is to be interpreted as an average over the entire survey"} (OSS-REQ-0353; \citeds{LSE-30}). The values of these requirement parameters for transients are {\tt transSampleSNR} $=6$, {\tt transCompletenessMin} $=90\%$, and {\tt transPurityMin} $=95\%$. (For moving objects there is a separate specification for a threshold pertaining to {\tt transSampleSNR} $=5$, {\tt mopsCompletenessMin} $=99\%$, and {\tt mopsPurityMin} $=50\%$; OSS-REQ-0354, \citeds{LSE-30}). This spuriousness threshold {\tt T} will allow users to filter their stream to a fiducial completeness and purity, thereby reducing the fraction of false positives (sources detected that are not astrophysical in origin). Brokers could request a pre-filtered stream that includes a restriction on spuriousness.

\section{The LSST Alert Filtering Service} \label{sec:LAFS}

{\bf It is a formal requirement that the LSST provide an alerts filtering service for users.}\dmreq{0342}\dmreq{0348} 

The LSST alerts filtering service is a mechanism by which users -- individuals with LSST data rights and access -- can receive alerts via pre-defined filters that have been optimized for established transient classifications such as supernovae, and/or create and apply their own filters to the stream \citedsp{LPM-17,LSE-61}. 

% The SRD specifies that {\it "users will have an option of a query-like pre-filtering of the [alert] data stream in order to select likely candidates for specific transient type"} and that {\it "several pre-defined filters optimized for traditionally popular transients, such as supernovae and microlensed sources, will also be available"} \citedsp{LPM-17}. This flows down directly to the DMSR, which has a formal requirement that {\it "a basic, limited capacity, alert filtering service shall be provided that can be given user defined filters to reduce the alert stream to manageable levels"}, and that this service include {\it "a predefined set of simple filters"} (DMS-REQ-0342, -0348; \citeds{LSE-61}). 


% % % % % % % % % % % % %
\subsection{Number of Simultaneous Users}\label{ssec:LAFS_users}

{\bf It is a formal requirement that the LSST alert filtering service be able to support\reqparam{numBrokerUsers}\dmreq{0343} a minimum of $100$ simultaneous users.}

This requirement is driven by outbound bandwidth limitations from the Data Access Center at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, and the DM team is currently investigating approaches that would support larger numbers of active filters \citedsp{LDM-612}. During LSST Operations, if the total number of simultaneous users is oversubscribed then a proposal process may be instituted \citedsp{LSE-163}.

% The DMSR specifies that the LSST {\it "alert filtering service shall support {\tt numBrokerUsers} simultaneous users"}, where {\tt numBrokerUsers} $=100$ (DMS-REQ-0343; \citeds{LSE-61}).

% {\it "requirement on the number of simultaneously connected users and number of passed alerts is largely driven by outbound bandwidth limitations from the DAC at NCSA. We are investigating approaches that would support larger numbers of active filters"} (page 12; ).


% % % % % % % % % % % % %
\subsection{Number of Alerts per Visit Returned}\label{ssec:LAFS_returns}

{\bf It is a formal requirement that the LSST alert filtering service be able to return $20$\reqparam{numBrokerAlerts}\dmreq{0343} full-sized alerts per visit per user.}

Assuming $1,000$ visits per night (\S~\ref{ssec:transN}), each user's filter will be capable of returning $20,000$ alerts per night, which would amount to $\sim1.6$ $\rm GB$ (\S~\ref{ssec:packet_size}).

% The DMSR specifies that within the LSST alert filtering service {\it "each user [shall be] allocated a bandwidth capable of receiving the equivalent of {\tt numBrokerAlerts} alerts per visit"}, where {\tt numBrokerAlerts} $=20$ (DMS-REQ-0343; \citeds{LSE-61}). 


% % % % % % % % % % % % %
\subsection{Alerts Database}\label{ssec:LAFS_adb}

{\bf It is a formal requirement that all alerts be stored in a database and available for query.}\ossreq{0185}

The term "available for query" applies to users with data rights and access to the LSST Science Platform. Like all other Prompt data products, the alerts database will be updated within $24$\reqparam{L1PublicT}\lsrreq{0104} hours \citedsp{LSE-29}. The alerts database is not a part of the LSST alert filtering service, but is included in this section to emphasize that science users who do not need a latency of $<24$ hours may wish to query the alerts database instead of creating filters.

% The OSS states that {\it "All published transient alerts ... shall be available for query"}, and this applies to users with data rights and access to the LSST science platform (OSS-REQ-0185; \citeds{LSE-30}).
