The purpose of this RFC is to solicit input on a draft Change Request which will clarify requirements and specifications in the OSS (LSE-29) and the DMSR (LSE-61) that are related to the alert stream. First we list the proposed changes (Items 1 through 5), and then their motivations (Issues A through E).


# # # # #
Item 1: OSS-REQ-0127 (Issues A and B)

Update the statement 
"Alerts shall be made available within time OTT1 from the conclusion of readout of the raw exposures used to generate each alert to the distribution of the alert to community distribution mechanisms."
to instead say
"Alerts shall be made available within time OTT1 from the conclusion of the camera's readout of the raw exposures used to generate each alert. The minimum fraction of alerts per visit released within a latency of OTT1 is OTR1."

Note: in the OSS, it is acceptable to use OTT1 and OTR1 without definitions because they are definied in the LSR, and the OSS inherits from the LSR.

Item 2: OSS-REQ-0112 (Issues B and D)

Update the statement
"No more than sciVisitAlertFailure % of science visits read out in the camera [and specified
to be analyzed by Data Management] shall fail to be subjected to alert generation and distribution, integrated over all stages of data handling ..."
to instead say
"No more than sciVisitAlertFailure % of science visits read out in the camera [and specified
to be analyzed by Data Management] shall fail to be subjected to alert generation and distribution, or fail to distribute any of the generated alerts, integrated over all stages of data handling ..."

Update the statement
"No more than sciVisitAlertDelay % of science visits read out in the camera [and specified to be analyzed by Data Management] shall have their alert generation and distribution completed later than the SRD specification for alert latency (OTT1)."
to instead say
"No more than sciVisitAlertDelay % of science visits read out in the camera [and specified to be analyzed by Data Management] shall fail to have at least OTR1 % of the alerts from that visit made available with a latency less than or equal to OTT1."


# # # # #
Item 3: DMS-REQ-0004 (Issues A, B, and D)

Update the statement 
"Alerts shall be made available within time OTT1 from the conclusion of the camera's readout of the raw exposures used to generate each alert to the distribution of the alert to community distribution mechanisms."
to instead say
"Alerts shall be made available within time OTT1 from the conclusion of readout of the raw exposures used to generate each alert. The minimum fraction of alerts per visit released within a latency of OTT1 is OTR1; all alerts per visit must be released or the visit is considered to have failed alert distribution (see sciVisitAlertFailure)."

Also add OTR1 as a new row in the table in Section 1.3.1 of the DMSR, which currently defines L1PublicT and OTT1. The columns would be as follows.

description = Minimum fraction of alerts per visit which must be made available within OTT1.
value = 98
unit = %
name = OTR1

Item 4: New DMS-REQ-???? for alert delay/failure. (Issues C and D)

In Section 2.2.3 “Transient Alert Distribution", add a new subsection and a new table.

Section 2.2.3.2 "Alert Delay and Failure Tolerances"ID: DMS-REQ-????Specification: The system shall reliably produce alerts for standard science visits read out in the camera [and specified to be analyzed by Data Management] such that no more than sciVisitAlertDelay % of visits shall fail to make at least OTR1 % of its alerts available within OTT1, and no more than sciVisitAlertFailure % of visits shall fail to generate and/or release all of the alerts for that visit (integrated over all stages of data handling from image acquisition to alert transmission). 
Derived from Requirements: OSS-REQ-0112

Table Row 1
description = Maximum fraction of science visits for which alerts are
generated but more than OTR1 are made available with a latency greater than OTT1.
specification
value = 1
unit = %
name = sciVisitAlertDelay

Table Row 2
description = Maximum fraction of science visits for which all alerts are not generated and/or released.
value = 0.1
unit = %
name = sciVisitAlertFailure


# # # # #
Item 5: New DMS-REQ-???? for the number of alerts per visit. (Issue E)

Add a new subsection to Section 2.2.3 “Transient Alert Distribution".

Section 2.2.3.1 "Performance Requirements for Transient Alert Distribution"
ID: DMS-REQ-????
Specification: The system shall be able to identify and release an average of at least nAlertNightAvg alerts per night, and a maximum of nAlertVisitMax for a single visit.
Derived from Requirements: LSR-REQ-0101, OSS-REQ-0193

Also, add a new table to define the two parameters being flowed-down from the OSS.

description = The long-term average number of alerts per night. 
value = 1e7
unit = alerts per night
name = nAlertNightAvg

description = The instantaneous maximum number of alerts per visit.
value = 4e4
unit = alerts per visit
name = nAlertVisitMax

Issue A: The Definition of OTT1 (Items 1 and 3)
There is a mild amount of conflict in the formal requirements regarding the definition of OTT1 = 60 seconds. The SRD states that OTT1 is a requirement on the "releasing" of an alert (page 40); the LSR states that OTT1 is a requirement on the "reporting" of an alert (LSR-REQ-0101), and then later that it is the time for "transmitting" the alert to the broker (LSR-REQ-0025). The OSS and DMSR have identical language which defines OTT1 as ending at the time of "the distribution of the alert to community distribution mechanisms", which could be misinterpreted as "distribution of the alert to brokers", or even less accurately, as "the broker receives the alert". The intent of OTT1 is that it covers only the time that the DMS has control over: from the end of camera readout to the time the alert packet "crosses the border" of NCSA and becomes publicly available for the brokers. The terms adopted for OTT1 should be from "the end of camera readout" to "when the alert is made available" (i.e., does not include transmission to the broker). We therefore propose slight modifications to the specifications regarding OTT1 in the OSS and DMSR, but leave the various phrases in the SRD and LSR as they are. 

Issue B: The Flow-Down of OTR1 (Items 1, 2, and 3)
The LSR requires that the alerts be "transmitted within the specified latency OTT1 for at least a fraction OTR1 of instances where the image data contains a transient detectable by the algorithm", where OTR1 = 98% (LSR-REQ-0025). The parameter OTR1 does not appear in the OSS or the DMSR, but it should. 

Issue C: The Flow-Down of Alert Delay/Failure Specs (Item 4)
OSS-REQ-0122 defines the acceptable fraction of visits that should produce alerts which may fail to produce alerts (sciVisitAlertFailure = 0.1%) or may produce delayed alerts (sciVisitAlertDelay = 1%). These specifications are not flowed-down to the DMSR, but they should be.

Issue D: The Fraction of Failed Alerts per Visit Should Be Zero (Items 2, 3 and 4)
Two facts, for context: (1) The parameter OTR1 defines the fraction of alerts per visit which may be delayed and transmitted with latency greater than OTT1. (2) The parameter sciVisitAlertFailure defines the fraction of visits which may fail to produce alerts. The issue is that there is no parameter which defines an acceptable fraction of alerts per visit which may fail to be released. With regards to OTR1 and delayed alerts, LSR-REQ-0025 states that “the remaining transients so detectable must still be identified and recorded at the next processing opportunity". From this I infer that the acceptable fraction of alerts per visit which may fail to be released is be 0%. In other words, all alerts that can be released must be released. This should be explicitly stated in the OSS and DMSR.

Issue E: Number of Alerts per Visit (Item 5)
There is a mild amount of tension in the formal requirements regarding the number of alerts per visit. The SRD and the LSR define transN (=1e4) as the number of alerts per visit that the system be capable of reporting, but the LSR points out that it remains unclear whether that is an instantaneous or average minimum. The OSS specifies that "The LSST Data Management system shall be sized to accommodate an average value of at least nAlertVisitAvg alerts generated per standard visit while meeting all its other requirements," where nAlertVisitAvg = 1e4 (OSS-REQ-0193). No corresponding requirement is flowed down to the DMSR, but should be.
